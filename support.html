        <p class="support1">During the COVID-19 pandemic, Asians and people of Asian descent became targets of racism and xenophobia. The use of terms like "Chinese virus" and "Wuhan virus" by politicans and the mass media fueled the use of hate speech and spread misinformation and conspiracy theories that demonize immigrants and refugees. Victims of hate crime suffered from assaults, threats, and discrimination, which instilled widespread fear and anxiety among Asian communities. For small business that have already been in the red due to lockdowns and operating at limited capacity witnessed a sharper decline in patronage as the anti-Asian racism led to a boycott of Asian establishments.</p>
